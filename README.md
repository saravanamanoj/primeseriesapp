## Introduction
This prime number series generator is a simple Spring Boot application that calculates and generates a series of prime numbers lesser than a given input limit.
This project is designed to showcase how to develop a Spring Boot application with a REST API endpoint for generating prime numbers.
This application uses Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the prime numbers series efficiently.

## Fetaures
- Generate a series of prime numebrs lesser than the input limit
- Efficient implementation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes alogorithm.
- Restful API for easy integration into other applications.
